# Auto Recipe — Recipe Index & Recommendation

This skill indexes every shipped recipe and helps users pick the right starting
config, adjust parallelism, and avoid common pitfalls.

## How to Use This Skill

1. Ask the user for: **model name/size**, **GPU count & type**, **training goal**
   (pretrain / SFT / PEFT), and **sequence length** (if non-default).
2. Look up the best-match recipe in the index below.
3. Recommend the recipe function name + entry-point command.
4. Provide adjustment advice (parallelism resizing, batch tuning, pitfalls).

## First Answer Checklist

When recommending recipes, always include these distinctions before the long
index details:

1. **Library recipes** under `src/megatron/bridge/recipes/` are for functional
   training and use `scripts/training/run_recipe.py`.
2. **Benchmark recipes** under `src/megatron/bridge/perf_recipes/` are for
   upper-bound throughput benchmarks. They own their canonical benchmark data
   and settings and should not be presented as production training recipes.
3. For a first-time Bridge smoke test, recommend `llama3_8b_pretrain_config`
   with mock data via `--dataset mock`.
4. For normal SFT recommendations, select a finetuning preset such as
   `--dataset squad` or `--dataset tulu3`; for pretrain and mock validation
   recommendations, use `--dataset mock`. Do not pair the pretraining-only
   `mock` preset with an SFT or PEFT mode.
5. After the recipe and dataset, give the required resizing rules: TP must
   divide `num_key_value_heads`, use the lowest TP that still fits the dense
   state, keep TP within one node unless using NVL72-class interconnect, enable
   SP when TP > 1, configure CP for long context, and make both dense and
   expert meshes divide the allocation.
6. State whether each proposed override changes the convergence contract or
   only the execution/performance mapping. Do not trade convergence semantics
   for throughput without calling it a new experiment.

## Configuration Layers and Change Control

Separate training semantics from their hardware mapping before recommending or
tuning a recipe.

**Convergence configuration** includes the starting checkpoint and trainable
parameters; dataset/revision/split/order/seeds; tokenizer, masking, truncation,
and packing; sequence length; global batch and token budget; objective and loss
coefficients; natural or forced MoE routing and token-dropping policy;
optimizer, LR, schedule, warmup, betas, epsilon, weight decay, clipping, and
dropout; arithmetic and optimizer-state precision; and PEFT adapter settings.
Changing one of these creates a new convergence experiment.

**Execution/performance configuration** includes hardware count and topology;
TP/PP/VP/CP/EP/ETP/DP/SP; recompute and offload; distributed optimizer/FSDP;
communication overlap; fusions and attention backends; CUDA graphs and
compilation; checkpoint I/O; and MoE transport through all-to-all, DeepEP, or
HybridEP when the routing policy is unchanged. These settings should preserve
the objective and effective updates, although floating-point reduction order
can produce small numerical drift that still needs validation.

Treat micro batch size and gradient accumulation as execution fingerprints.
Tune them only with fixed global batch size, global batch membership/order,
normalization, optimizer boundaries, and token budget, and validate fresh loss
sentinels for each layout. Packing, precision, forced MoE load balancing, token
dropping/capacity, and router/auxiliary loss changes are never performance-only
knobs.

Treat mock data, forced balancing, disabled correctness checks, and timing-only
schedules as benchmark-only shortcuts. They may be appropriate in
`perf_recipes`, but their losses and checkpoints are not convergence evidence.

For comparable model-verification recipes, choose a cohort-wide convergence
contract before tuning performance. Keep the same bounded data selection,
preprocessing, sequence length, global batch, optimizer/schedule, precision,
seeds, routing policy, optimizer-step horizon, and processed-token checkpoints
where the architectures permit. Record any necessary model-specific deviation
and do not present that result as apples-to-apples convergence evidence.
Absolute losses from different architectures or tokenizers are not directly
rankable; compare stability and trend at equal token counts.

When a recipe's batch disagrees with the chosen convergence contract, modify
and validate the library recipe separately. A declared bounded-verification
protocol may explicitly apply the same LR, schedule, sequence, and data
overrides across a cohort, but do not make one-off convergence changes merely
to improve throughput. Conversely, first try TP/PP/CP/EP, recompute/offload,
dispatcher transport, overlap, fusion, and CUDA graphs when optimizing fit or
throughput.

## Entry Points

### Library recipes (functional training)

```bash
# Pretrain with mock data
uv run python -m torch.distributed.run --nproc_per_node=8 scripts/training/run_recipe.py \
    --recipe <recipe_function_name> \
    --dataset mock

# SFT with SQuAD
uv run python -m torch.distributed.run --nproc_per_node=8 scripts/training/run_recipe.py \
    --recipe <recipe_function_name> \
    --dataset squad

# Override any field via CLI
uv run python -m torch.distributed.run --nproc_per_node=8 scripts/training/run_recipe.py \
    --recipe llama3_8b_pretrain_config \
    --dataset mock \
    'model.tensor_model_parallel_size=2' \
    'train.global_batch_size=64'
```

### Benchmark recipes (throughput benchmarks)

```bash
./scripts/training/train.sh \
    --nodes 2 --gpus-per-node 8 \
    --account ACCOUNT --partition PARTITION --container-image IMAGE \
    --recipe qwen3_30b_a3b_pretrain_16gpu_h100_bf16_config \
    --mode pretrain
```

The total GPU allocation must match the count encoded in the recipe name. The
user selects the node shape, and the selected partition must provide the
requested hardware. The launcher does not inject benchmark offline defaults or
cluster-specific launch policy. Use `--env NAME` for exported offline or NCCL
fabric settings and repeated `--srun-arg=ARG` options for `srun`.
Configure CPU/NUMA wrappers and Slurm segment sizing through the target cluster
integration, or use `scripts/performance/setup_experiment.py` when its compatibility
policies are required. The unified
launcher supports exact exported text pretraining, text SFT/PEFT, Qwen-VL
pretraining, and Wan pretraining recipes and infers their forward step. Text
SFT/PEFT text benchmark recipes retain the flat runner's mock-data default;
Qwen-VL and Wan retain their model-specific datasets. Exported benchmark PEFT
recipes are fixed LoRA configs; use a configurable library recipe for DoRA.
Trailing `KEY=VALUE` overrides are accepted, but an overridden benchmark
recipe no longer represents its canonical benchmark configuration. Use
`scripts/performance/setup_experiment.py` for selector-based invocation,
dataset replacement, topology resizing, and specialized benchmark controls.

See the Benchmark Recipe Index for important caveats before using these for
anything beyond throughput benchmarking.

---

## Benchmark Recipe Layout

Benchmark recipes use the same **Python function** format as library recipes,
but live in a dedicated namespace for throughput benchmarking:

- Benchmark recipes live in `src/megatron/bridge/perf_recipes/<family>/<hardware>/<model>.py`
- Each benchmark recipe is a **self-contained Python function** (e.g. `llama3_8b_pretrain_8gpu_h100_bf16_config()`)
- Recipe names encode model, task, GPU count, hardware, precision, and optional variant
- `scripts/performance/utils/utils.py` derives compatibility `WorkloadBaseConfig` views from the flat recipe itself
- Shared helpers: `_benchmark_common()` (50 iters, timing, TE RNG), `_perf_precision()` (bf16 / fp8_cs / fp8_mx / nvfp4)

**Why Python, not YAML?** Previous YAML-based approaches had problems:
recipe logic was split across multiple indirection layers, configs were not
self-contained, and the two-level pipeline made maintenance and debugging
difficult. Python functions are explicit, greppable, and composable.

The training launcher discovers library and benchmark recipes from the
complete exported function name. Five legacy duplicate names select the
benchmark definition; use the corresponding generic alias for those functional
workloads. New recipe names should be unique across both packages.

## Recipe Index (Library & Benchmark)

The full per-family recipe tables — every shipped **library** recipe
(`src/megatron/bridge/recipes/`) and **benchmark** recipe
(`src/megatron/bridge/perf_recipes/`), with parallelism degrees, minimum GPU
counts, and hardware coverage — are kept in a dedicated reference file so this
skill stays concise:

**→ See [`references/recipe-index.md`](references/recipe-index.md)** — Library
Recipe Index (Llama, Qwen2/2.5/3, Qwen3-MoE, Qwen3-Next, DeepSeek, GLM-4.5,
Gemma, Nemotron, VLM, Diffusion) and Benchmark Recipe Index (per-hardware
throughput configs).

parallelism; the guidance below tells you which entry to look up.

## Adjustment Advice (When Recommending)

### Parallelism Resizing Rules

When the user's GPU count differs from the recipe default:

1. **TP must divide `num_key_value_heads`** (GQA constraint). E.g. if
   `num_key_value_heads=8`, valid TP = {1, 2, 4, 8}.
2. **TP should stay within a single node** (NVLink). TP > 8 requires
   inter-node NVLink (e.g., GB200 NVL72).
3. **PP adds pipeline bubbles.** Minimize PP; only increase when TP alone can't
   fit the model. Use VP (virtual pipeline) to mitigate bubble overhead.
4. **EP doesn't reduce dense-layer memory.** Only expert parameters shard with
   EP. Shared attention/embeddings are replicated. For "OOM with MoE", increase
   EP first, not TP.
5. **SP should be True whenever TP > 1.** It eliminates redundant activation
   copies and is essentially free.
6. **CP requires all-to-all or ring attention.** Check `cp_comm_type`. For
   GQA models, `a2a+p2p` hierarchical CP allows CP > num_kv_heads.
7. **Dense and expert meshes overlap.** Do not multiply TP and EP together.
   The minimum MoE world size is `PP × max(TP × CP, EP × ETP)`. Dense DP is
   `world_size / (TP × PP × CP)` and expert EDP is
   `world_size / (PP × EP × ETP)`; both quotients must be integral, and the
   expert count must be divisible by EP.

### Fit-First, Then Fill Tuning Loop

For an MoE recipe on a fixed allocation, use this practical order:

1. Start with the lowest legal TP that can hold the dense parameters,
   optimizer state, and workspaces. Do not raise TP only to reduce activation
   memory; TP communication is expensive, so try recompute first.
2. Use the largest legal EP that matches the expert count and topology. EP=8
   is a common first candidate on one 8-GPU node, and EP=32 is a common first
   candidate on a 32-GPU allocation. These are starting points, not universal
   defaults: EP shards expert weights only, not dense layers or activations.
3. Prefer architecture-specific selective recompute. For Qwen3.5 GDN layers,
   verify `gdn_norm_out` on the exact Megatron Core revision instead of
   assuming `core_attn` covers the GDN peak. Use full-layer recompute only when
   the targeted boundaries still do not make the complete step fit.
4. After a stable baseline completes optimizer initialization and several
   steady steps, inspect W&B memory and confirm every rank's peak allocated and
   reserved memory in the runtime logs; rank 0 can miss the hot EP or PP rank.
   If there is safe headroom, test one change at a time: lower TP by one legal
   step or increase MBS while keeping GBS, data order, and optimizer boundaries
   fixed.
5. Keep the candidate only when it improves end-to-end tokens/s/GPU or step
   time with healthy loss and no skipped/NaN iterations. Leave headroom for
   checkpointing, evaluation, routing imbalance, and optional CUDA graphs.

On EP=8, a large expert footprint can remain capacity-limited enough to need
full recompute. EP=32 usually reduces expert-weight pressure substantially,
making selective recompute a better candidate, but Qwen3.5 GDN coverage and
the hot rank's measured peak still decide.

### Batch Size Tuning

- Start with the recipe's `micro_batch_size`. If OOM, reduce to 1; after the
  run fits, use measured headroom to sweep MBS upward again.
- `global_batch_size` determines learning dynamics. Scale with DP:
  `GBS = micro_batch_size × DP × gradient_accumulation_steps`.
- For MoE, `micro_batch_size=1` is typical at scale.

### Common Pitfalls to Warn About

| Pitfall | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| TP > num_kv_heads | Crash: "TP must divide num_query_groups" | Reduce TP to a divisor of num_kv_heads |
| PP without VP | Poor throughput (large bubble) | Set `virtual_pipeline_model_parallel_size` |
| EP too low for large MoE | OOM on expert params | Increase EP; each expert lives on EP/num_experts ranks |
| CUDA graphs + packed sequences | Assert: "CUDA graph accepts only Tensor inputs" | Disable packing or use `local` full-iteration graphs |
| CUDA graphs + full recompute | Assert: "full recompute only with full iteration CUDA graph" | Disable recompute or switch to `local` impl |
| `use_te_rng_tracker` not set | Assert on provider init when CUDA graphs enabled | Set `cfg.model.use_te_rng_tracker = True` and `cfg.rng.te_rng_tracker = True` |
| FSDP + TP > 1 on H100 | Possible comm bottleneck | Prefer FSDP with TP=1 or TP=2 on H100; FSDP shines on GB/B-series |
| Long context without CP | OOM on activations | Add CP=2/4/8; use `*_16k`, `*_64k`, or `*_128k` recipe variants |
| MoE `overlap_grad_reduce` on H100 | May hurt throughput (False in many H100 presets) | Set `overlap_grad_reduce=False` for MoE on H100 |
| VLM SFT missing image data | Runs but produces garbage | Provide actual multimodal dataset or use mock VLM data |
| Qwen35-VL MoE FSDP | Tested on Blackwell only | May not work on H100; validate first |
