## Description: <br>
Used for converting one CT DICOM series folder to a HU NIfTI volume with affine evidence. Not for multi-frame DICOM or clinical use. <br>

This skill is for research and development only. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache-2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers converting single-series CT DICOM directories to HU-scaled NIfTI volumes with affine and orientation metadata for engineering verification workflows. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [No] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Skill Output: <br>
**Output Type(s):** [Files, Analysis] <br>
**Output Format:** [NIfTI volume (.nii.gz) and JSON summary] <br>
**Output Parameters:** [1D] <br>
**Other Properties Related to Output:** [None] <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
2 evaluation tasks (1 positive, 1 negative) with 3 attempts per task, each in an isolated sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Whether the skill is safe to use: checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Whether the answer is correct against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the right skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Whether the skill helped complete the user's goal (50% goal completion + 50% expected workflow adherence). <br>
- Efficiency: Whether the skill avoided wasted tool calls and token usage (50% tool-call productivity + 50% token efficiency). <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity (routing scored under Discoverability). <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion token usage. <br>

| Overall | 92.2% | 91.5% |
| Security | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) | 50.0% → 100.0% (+50.0 points) |
| Correctness | 15.0% → 100.0% (+85.0 points) | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) |
| Discoverability | 80.0% | 80.0% |
| Effectiveness | 31.9% → 97.5% (+65.6 points) | 80.0% → 96.3% (+16.3 points) |
| Efficiency | 83.4% | 81.2% |
