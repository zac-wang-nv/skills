# Agent Evaluation

Read this file for agentic task-driven evaluation, direct SDK runners, platform
`agent-evaluate` jobs, tasksets, precomputed trials, or Harbor and custom runners.

## Choose standalone SDK or platform job

Use `AgentEvaluator` for lightweight in-process evaluation that does not require a running nemo-platform:

```python
from nemo_evaluator_sdk.agent_eval.evaluator import AgentEvaluator

result = await AgentEvaluator().run(tasks=tasks, target=target)
print(result.trials)
print(result.summary)
```

The standalone target union is:

- `Model`
- `GenericAgent`
- Any object implementing `nemo_evaluator_sdk.agent_eval.trials.AgentTaskRunner` protocol

For a minimal direct runner:

```python
from nemo_evaluator_sdk.agent_eval.runtimes.callable_runtime import (
    CallableAgentTaskRunner,
)

async def answer(task):
    return task.inputs["instruction"]

runner = CallableAgentTaskRunner(answer)
result = await AgentEvaluator().run(tasks=tasks, target=runner)
```

Submit the plugin job when platform execution is required:

```bash
nemo evaluator agent-evaluate explain
nemo evaluator agent-evaluate submit \
  --spec-file skills/nemo-evaluator-plugin/assets/specs/fabric_agent_eval.json
```

A `GymAgentTaskRunner` already working under `AgentEvaluator()` can be submitted directly, without
describing its configuration a second time as a spec. Pass the live runner as `target` and a stored taskset as
`tasks`:

```python
from nemo_evaluator.api.schemas import TasksetRef
from nemo_evaluator_sdk.agent_eval.runtimes.gym import GymAgentTaskRunner, GymRuntimeConfig

runner = GymAgentTaskRunner(
    config=GymRuntimeConfig(
        agent="simple_agent",
        agent_config="c.yaml",
        resources_server="mcqa",
    )
)
job = client.evaluator.submit(tasks=TasksetRef("my-suite"), target=runner)
job.wait_until_done()
```

`submit` has two shapes discriminated by what is supplied: `tasks` + `target` evaluates a stored
taskset, and `metric` + `dataset` evaluates rows. Supplying both, or passing a runner to the row
path, raises `TypeError` rather than running the wrong job. The row-only options — `config`,
`field_mapping`, `prompt_template`, `metric_bundle_packager` — are refused on the taskset path,
because a taskset run is configured by its runner instead.

Only a Gym runner can be converted into a target spec today. `submit` does that conversion with
`runner_to_target` (`nemo_evaluator.jobs.runner_targets`), which raises `UnsubmittableRunnerError`
for any other runner — for those, write the job input by hand with the matching runner target and
submit it, through the SDK or the CLI.

A Gym runner carrying state with no JSON form is refused for a different reason, and has a different
remedy. `hydra_params` is `dict[str, Any]`, so a callable or live object survives construction and
is rejected at submit. Writing the target by hand does not help: a hand-built `GymRunnerTarget`
fails the same `model_dump(mode="json")`, and a CLI `--spec` payload cannot encode the value either.
Replace it with something JSON-representable, or keep the run in-process with
`AgentEvaluator().run(...)`.

`submit` returns an `AgentEvaluatorJobResource`, which is read differently from the dataset-driven
job handle — see [Read results](#read-results).

## Build the job input

`AgentEvalInputSpec.tasks` accepts an inline task list or a stored `TasksetRef`.
Provide exactly one trial source:

- `target` to generate trials.
- `trials` to rescore precomputed trials.

`AgentEvalTaskInput` is the job-spec twin of the standalone SDK's
`AgentEvalTask`. The fields match; use `AgentEvalTaskInput` when building a
spec for `submit`.

```python
from nemo_evaluator.api.schemas import TaskInputs
from nemo_evaluator.jobs.agent_spec import (
    AgentEvalInputSpec,
    AgentEvalTaskInput,
    FabricRunnerTarget,
)

spec = AgentEvalInputSpec(
    tasks=[
        AgentEvalTaskInput(
            id="capital-france",
            intent="Name the capital of France.",
            inputs=TaskInputs(instruction="What is the capital of France?"),
            metrics=[metric_bundle],
        )
    ],
    target=FabricRunnerTarget(
        config={
            "metadata": {"name": "geography-smoke"},
            "harness": {"adapter_id": "nvidia.fabric.codex"},
        }
    ),
    max_concurrent_tasks=2,
    fail_fast=False,
    labels={"benchmark": "geography-smoke"},
)
```

`intent` is grader metadata and is never shown to the agent; only `inputs`
reaches it. Put the instruction the agent must act on in `inputs`.

Task metrics score against the task-driven template context
(`inputs.*`, `reference.*`, `task.*`, `trial.*`, `sample.output_text`), not the
dataset-driven `item.*` context.

Use `TasksetRef("default/geography")` with `submit` for persisted tasks. Stored
tasks carry the grader-only `reference` field too, so held-out per-task data
survives into taskset-driven runs; inline tasks are for one-off submissions.

Set `views` on a task to roll two or more of its metric outputs into one named,
reported score. See
[Score by Component](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-platform/documentation/evaluate-models/agent-eval/score-by-component).

## Choose a platform target

| Target | Use when |
| --- | --- |
| `ModelTarget` | Generate trials through an OpenAI-compatible model endpoint |
| `AgentTarget` | Generate trials through a generic HTTP or NeMo Agent Toolkit agent |
| `FabricRunnerTarget` | Run a configured NeMo [Fabric](https://github.com/nvidia/nemo-fabric) runner |
| `HarborRunnerTarget` | Run a Harbor task suite in Docker |
| `GymRunnerTarget` | Run a Gym environment and agent |

`ModelTarget` owns its `prompt_template` and online model params.
`AgentTarget` owns its agent request configuration. Runner targets are resolved
to an `AgentTaskRunner` inside the job runtime.

For [Fabric](https://github.com/nvidia/nemo-fabric), pass one complete `agent.yaml` as a JSON-shaped `config`; the
`harness.adapter_id` selects the harness:

```python
from nemo_evaluator.jobs.agent_spec import FabricRunnerTarget

target = FabricRunnerTarget(
    config={
        "metadata": {"name": "regression-suite"},
        "harness": {"adapter_id": "nvidia.fabric.codex"},
    },
    model="<provider>/<model>",
)
```

Do not use profile overlays. Fold the complete configuration into `config`.

`max_concurrent_tasks` limits tasks evaluated concurrently. Target-specific
settings such as inference parallelism or Harbor
`n_concurrent_trials` control concurrency inside trial generation.

## Use precomputed trials

Pass `trials=[...]` and omit `target` to rescore stored outputs and/or trajectories
without invoking the original model, agent, or runner. Keep stable `task_id`
values so trials match task definitions.

Individual trials are stored in the run bundle, not as queryable result entities.
Retrieve the run index, download its bundle, and hydrate `trials.jsonl`:

```python
from nemo_evaluator_sdk.agent_eval.persistence import read_trials

stored = client.evaluator.agent_eval_results.retrieve("<result-name>")
client.files.download(remote_path=stored.bundle_ref, local_path="previous-run")
trials = read_trials("previous-run")
```

CLI equivalent for downloading the bundle:

```bash
nemo jobs results download agent-eval-results \
  --job <job-name> --output-file agent-eval-results.tar.gz
mkdir -p previous-run
tar -xzf agent-eval-results.tar.gz -C previous-run --strip-components=1
```

Pass the hydrated `trials` with the same task definitions and omit `target`.

## Read results

A standalone run returns an `AgentEvalResult`:

- `result.summary` contains aggregate values per metric output plus coverage
  counts for scored, failed, and missing-output trials.
- `result.scores` contains one entry per task, trial, and metric, including
  metric outputs, status, and diagnostics.
- `result.trials` contains each agent output, its evidence, and its
  `completed`, `partial`, or `failed` status.
- `result.run_id` identifies the run; `result.benchmark` contains its grouping
  metadata.

When standalone `AgentEvalRunConfig.output_dir` is set, the same information is
written as a run bundle:

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `summary.json` | Aggregate mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, counts, and coverage |
| `scores.jsonl` | Per-task, trial, and metric outputs, status, and diagnostics |
| `trials.jsonl` | Trial outputs, evidence, metadata, and status |
| `tasks.jsonl` | Tasks included in the run |
| `run.json` | Run ID and artifact manifest |
| `benchmark.json` | Benchmark-grouping metadata |
| `report.html` | Browsable dashboard when dashboard generation is enabled |

Use the in-memory result for programmatic follow-up and the bundle for
inspection, sharing, or rescoring. Platform jobs persist the bundle and create
a queryable record under `client.evaluator.agent_eval_results`.

A platform job hands back an `AgentEvaluatorJobResource`, which is not the
dataset-driven job handle: it offers `name`, `job`, `get_job_status()`,
`check_if_complete()`, and `wait_until_done()`, but no `get_result()` or
`download_artifacts()`. Read the scores through
`client.evaluator.agent_eval_results`.

Inspect failed and partial trials and score diagnostics before interpreting
aggregate values; a high mean with low coverage can hide missing or failed
work.

## Configure Harbor as a task runner

Harbor requires its Python package, Docker access, and a Harbor dataset. Task
discovery records the source dataset in each task's
`harbor_dataset_path` metadata; the durable runtime recovers the dataset from
that metadata.

**Standalone SDK:**

```python
from pathlib import Path

from nemo_evaluator_sdk.agent_eval.runtimes.harbor_runtime import (
    HarborAgentTaskRunner,
    HarborRuntimeConfig,
    discover_harbor_tasks,
)

tasks = discover_harbor_tasks("path/to/harbor-suite")
runner = HarborAgentTaskRunner(
    config=HarborRuntimeConfig(
        jobs_dir=Path("harbor-jobs"),
        agent_name="oracle",
        n_attempts=1,
        n_concurrent_trials=2,
    )
)
result = await AgentEvaluator().run(tasks=tasks, target=runner)
```

**Platform SDK:**

```python
from nemo_evaluator.jobs.agent_spec import HarborRunnerTarget

target = HarborRunnerTarget(
    agent_name="oracle",
    n_attempts=1,
    n_concurrent_trials=2,
    max_retries=0,
    artifacts=["/workspace/output"],
    trace_dir="/app/traces",
    reward_key="reward",
)
```

Use `agent_import_path` for a custom Harbor agent and `agent_model_name` when
the agent requires a model. The module must be importable in the execution
environment. Durable execution additionally requires an execution image and
runtime that provide Harbor and Docker access.
